## Using Ionic with Angular

### [Environment Setup](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/environment)

- [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### [CLI installation](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/cli)

### [VS Code extension](https://ionicframework.com/docs/intro/vscode-extension)

## Git

I recommend to use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to manage git. Also you can work from a terminal too.

## Branching and Pull Request Guidelines

### Branching Strategy

1. For every task or feature, create a new branch from the `dev` branch.
2. Use descriptive branch names that reflect the task or feature you're working on.
3. Commit your changes to the respective branch.

Example:

```bash
git checkout dev            # Switch to the dev branch
git pull origin dev         # Pull the latest changes from the remote dev branch
git checkout -b featureX    # Create and switch to a new branch for featureX
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Once your task is completed, create a pull request from your branch to the `dev` branch.
2. Provide a clear and concise title and description for your pull request, detailing the changes made and the purpose of the task.
3. Assign reviewers to the pull request. Someone else should review and approve your changes before merging into `dev`.
4. Make any necessary adjustments based on the feedback received.
5. Once approved, merge your branch into `dev` using the "Squash and merge" option if necessary.

Example:

```bash
# Assuming you are on your featureX branch
git push origin featureX     # Push your changes to the remote featureX branch
```

### Using GitHub Issues

If you encounter difficulties or have questions while working on a task, feel free to create a GitHub issue. Use issues to discuss problems, ask for clarification, or seek guidance on how to solve specific issues.
